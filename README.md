# 📅 Progress Log

## ✅ Day 1 – Introduction to Swift & Setup
- Installed Xcode
- Learned how Swift files work
- Wrote my first Swift program
- Understood `print()` statements
- Basic syntax structure

---

## ✅ Day 2 – Variables, Constants & If-Else

### 🔹 Variables vs Constants
- `let` → Constant (cannot change value)
- `var` → Variable (value can change)

Example:

```swift
let someConstant: Bool = true
var someVariable: String = "Hello"

---

## ✅ Day 3 – Operators & Functions

### 🔹 Operators
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
- Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Operator precedence (PEMDAS)
- Else-if ladder

Example:
if (likeCount > 3 && commentCount > 0) || likeCount < 5 {
    print("Condition satisfied")
}
### 🔹 Functions
- Function declaration
- Function calling
- Functions with return types
- Functions with parameters
- Code reusability

Example:
func checkUserStatus(didCompleteOnboarding: Bool, profileIsCreated: Bool) -> Bool {
    return didCompleteOnboarding && profileIsCreated
}
